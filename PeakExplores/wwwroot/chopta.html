        <h2>About Chopta Chandrashila</h2>
        <!--<p>Chopta is a serene hamlet in Uttarakhand offering majestic views of the Himalayas. Trekking to Tungnath and Chandrashila provides panoramic views of Nanda Devi, Trishul, and Chaukhamba.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visit the highest Shiva temple - Tungnath</li>
            <li>Summit the Chandrashila peak for 360° views</li>
            <li>Enjoy the tranquil meadows and dense forests</li>
        </ul>-->
        <p>
            Situated at an altitude of 13,000 feet, Chandrashila is renowned for its mesmerizing views of the surrounding peaks, including the majestic Nanda Devi. Chopta is known as the ‘Mini Switzerland of India’. This trek takes you through lush green meadows, thick forests, and offers stunning views of the Himalayas.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trek typically begins from Chopta, winding through enchanting forests, charming meadows and culminating at the Tungnath Temple—the highest Shiva shrine in the world. The final ascent to Chandrashila Peak rewards trekkers with panoramic views of the Himalayan range.
        </p> <p>
            The trek takes you on a beautiful loop to Chandrashila Peak, passing by the breathtaking Deoriatal Lake, offering an incredible collection of snow peaks. Deoriatal is the first significant point in the journey, located at a height of 7,800 feet and surrounded by forests. In front of the lake, the Chaukhamba massif shimmers, and its reflection is visible in the crystal clear water, creating a stunning effect. These unique experiences and sights are sure to inspire and captivate any nature lover.
        </p> <p>
            The place is full of legends, and according to one story, the five brothers from the epic poem Mahabharata were once thirsty and came to Deoriatal for water, where they had to face an examination of their wisdom. They made unforgettable memories the first night they spent here under the star-filled sky. The next step in the journey is the meadows, which transform into snowfields on the way to Chopta. Along the trail, you can see spectacular mountains such as Bandarpooch, Kedar, and Chaukhamba, among others.
        </p> <p>
            These stunning features of the Garhwal Himalayas are even more impressive from the top of Chandrashila and remain unforgettable until the end of the summit section at the Tunganath temple. The Deoriatal Chandrashila trek is situated within The Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary in Uttarakhand and is a delight for those who love wildlife. It is also an excellent summit hike (12,083 feet) for those beginning to trek in the Himalayas. Summit climbs and hiking through mountains for hours in the early hours of the morning are enjoyable. This trek is a testament to the awe-inspiring beauty and rich wildlife of the Himalayas, inviting a deep sense of connection and appreciation for nature.
        </p> <p>
            The summit is reached just as the sun’s rays illuminate the sky. Everything below you is clouds, hills, and tiny bits of civilization. You typically observe mountains far away when you go on a Himalayan hike. However, Deoriatal Chandrashila stands out because you can see all the major summits in Western and Eastern Uttarakhand from the summit, making it a unique and unforgettable experience. Chopta Chandrashila Deorital is a trek for everyone to enjoy, ideal for nature lovers, bird-watchers, and photographers alike.
