    <section class="about">
        <h2>About Roopkund Trek</h2>
        <p>Roopkund, often referred to as the “Mystery Lake,” is one of India’s most intriguing and sought-after high-altitude treks, located at an elevation of approximately 16,500 feet in the lap of the Himalayas. This glacier lake earned global attention due to the discovery of hundreds of ancient human skeletons that surface when the snow melts—an archaeological enigma that continues to fascinate trekkers and researchers alike.</p>
        <p> The journey begins from the quaint village of Lohajung, leading adventurers through an awe-inspiring blend of dense oak and rhododendron forests, crystal-clear streams, and expansive alpine meadows like Ali Bugyal and Bedni Bugyal—two of the most scenic high-altitude grasslands in the country. As you ascend higher, the trail unfolds dramatic ridgelines, high-altitude campsites, and changing landscapes, offering a thrilling mix of adventure and natural beauty. </p>
        <p> The trek not only tests one’s endurance but also rewards with stunning panoramic views of the towering Himalayan peaks, including Mt. Trishul, Nanda Ghunti, Chaukhamba, and Neelkanth. The final approach to Roopkund Lake, through a snow-laden, steep glacier climb, is as exhilarating as it is challenging, making it a dream trek for seasoned hikers. </p>
        <p> Roopkund Trek is best suited for experienced trekkers who are physically fit and mentally prepared for high-altitude conditions. The best time to undertake this trek is between May to June and September to October, when the trails are accessible and the weather is relatively stable. Whether it’s the haunting mystery of the lake, the surreal landscapes, or the rich cultural encounters in remote Himalayan villages, Roopkund offers a deeply enriching and unforgettable experience. </p>
